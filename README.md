# Introducing Heather Williams

#### Hello and welcome to Introducing me, Heather Williams. 
I attended W.O.Mitchell Elementary School for grade 5-8. I went to Roch Carrier Elementary School for kindergarten-grade 4. :school_satchel: 
I was born to the _loving_ family of my Mom, Shannon Williams and my Dad, Kerry Williams. I have three sisters. Amber, the eldest, is 16, Megan, my twin who is 14 and my youngest sister, Erin who is 8 years old.:family:  
Megan and I take dance classes at Allegro Danceworks. This is my **favourite** hobby, because dance has no stress. If you have had a bad day at school, dance helps you to relax.
 Another way I relax myself is to read **lots of books**. My favourite series is Harry Potter.:books: 
I love listening to music when I’m doing homework. My favourite song is _“She Ain’t There To Kiss Me”_ by Brett Young. I also listen to any song from the musicals Les Miserables and Mammamia.:musical_note: My favourite actors are Eddie Redmayne and Amanda Seyfried. 
_Anything_ italian is my favourite food, _I love spaghetti the most,_ italian food is my **_all time favourite_** because it’s **amazing!!!!!** There are so many sauce recipes to make to even more excellent.:spaghetti: 
I do a paper route every Wednesday. I make $10 a week, good pocket money.
 My strengths are time management and organization. One of weaknesses is I put a lot of pressure on myself, which sometimes turns into a positive result. 
The language I speak is english. I don’t speak any other languages at home.
 I like to watch movies on the weekends with my family, and on the weeknights I dance, Monday through Friday. 
My favourite joke is _“What did the buffalo say to his son, when we went to off to school? Bi-son”_ 
What **I want** to get out of Business is to know how to work with computers and know business communications. 
The software I have used in the past is Google Spreadsheet, Openoffice, and most often Google Docs.:computer:
